      <h2>Each Teams Playoff Scenarios and Season Recaps</h2>
      <div class="section-content">

        <div class="game-recap">
1. dug (11–2, 2469.3 PF) – 1st place

Dug enters Week 14 as the league’s undisputed heavyweight. He’s already clinched the 1-seed and the first-round bye throughout the postseason. At 11–2 with the league’s highest PF by a wide margin, this has been a wire-to-wire season of dominance built on depth, clear lineup stability, and high-floor studs. Even this week, with a tough matchup against party cat, the pressure is almost nonexistent: the result simply does not matter for Dug’s playoff position.

Still, meaningful stakes exist in the margins. Dug’s PF is within striking distance of Pretzel’s for the “regular season points title,” and maintaining that crown matters for prestige and awards. His roster also enters Week 14 off a rare down week, meaning party cat may push him harder than expected. Dug also holds the power to alter the entire playoff bracket — a loss opens doors for the 7–6 bubble team in party cat, while a win most likely slams the door shut on their playoff hopes.

Week 14 is less about Dug himself and more about who he drags up or down with him. He’s the king of the league and is, if anything, just looking to build some momentum going into the playoffs.

2. El Pretzel (8–5, 2172.5 PF) – 2nd place

Pretzel comes into the final week sitting in a powerful but not quite safe spot. The 2-seed is his to lose, but the bye week is not fully secured. At 8–5 with a strong season-long resume and top-three PF, he’s exceeded expectations after a rocky midseason, leaning on smart roster churn, strong waiver adds, and big breakouts at WR and RB. But all of that security evaporates if things break the wrong way in Week 14 — because the dreaded Airhead PF swing looms.

El Pretzel only leads Airhead by 36.7 points for entering the week. If Pretzel loses to Maximum Effort and finishes 8–6, and Airhead wins to reach 8–6, then the bye is suddenly on the table. If Airhead outscores Pretzel by 37+ this week, Pretzel drops to the 3-seed. That’s the nightmare scenario, because it sends Pretzel into the dangerous 3/6 wildcard fight instead of resting on the bye week throne.

The matchup doesn’t help: Maximum Effort is a volatile but dangerous opponent fighting for his playoff life, meaning Pretzel is stepping into a must-win against a desperate team. Pretzel ultimately controls his destiny — win and the bye is locked — but the pressure is absolutely on. This is a high-stakes matchup where a single poor lineup decision could cost Pretzel an entire week of rest and prep.

3. Airhead (7–6, 2135.8 PF) – 3rd place

Airhead enters Week 14 in a fascinating spot but exciting spot. Already 95%+ safe for the playoffs thanks to strong PF and a forgiving matchup this week, yet still carrying a meaningful ceiling — including a realistic shot at stealing the 2-seed and a first-round bye. This team has been streaky but dangerous all season, buoyed by elite performances from Gibbs, Hall, and breakout weeks from depth RBs and WRs. The dicey early-season injuries and bye-week chaos have settled into stability, and Airhead now has one of the cleaner paths in the league.

The matchup is a nice way to end the season, CeeDeez Nuts (5–8), eliminated and is projected to score 20+ points lower. A win pushes Airhead to 8–6, which mathematically guarantees a playoff spot and locks him into the 2–6 range. But if Airhead wins and Pretzel loses, Airhead can steal the 2-seed by outscoring Pretzel by 37 or more. This is absolutely doable given Airhead’s projected total of 163.1 and Pretzel’s more modest projection of 154.2. The bye is not quite a longshot it is a live scenario, and it hinges entirely on the PF swing.

Even with a loss Airhead is almost certainly in the playoffs because he wins nearly all PF tiebreakers over the 7–6 and 6–7 teams. Only a worst case scenario kind of combination of events (loss + FINN monster game + Momma monster game + DEANS monster game) could drop him out. In all 64 possible worlds, Airhead misses the playoffs in only 1–2 of them.

Airhead is comfortably in, but Week 14’s mission is clear: secure the 3-seed minimum and take a shot at a bye if Pretzel stumbles.

4. Team Clark (7–6, 1988.4 PF) – 4th place

Few teams have ridden a more chaotic rollercoaster than Team Clark. From early injuries to QB instability to late-season surges, Clark enters Week 14 with a simple mandate: win and you’re in. The matchup, however, is treacherous — DEANS Dynasty (6–7), a team fighting for its season and sporting one of the three best PF totals among the bubble squads. Clark’s PF is the lowest among the 7–6 group, meaning he loses nearly every tiebreaker if he falls to 7–7. The stakes are brutally high.

In win worlds, Clark reaches 8–6 and is in the playoffs in 100% of scenarios, finishing anywhere from 3–6 depending on party cat, Airhead, and Maximum Effort results. But in loss worlds, Clark’s season becomes a coin flip weighted against him. In a full scenario sweep, Clark misses the playoffs in 56% of loss outcomes, primarily because both FINN and Momma’s Boys can pass him in PF with even modest scoring outings, and DEANS passes him by default with a head-to-head win + slight PF lift.

Clark doesn’t need a miracle — he just needs a solid scoring week and to avoid the bottom half of the Week 14 scoreboard. But with DEANS Dynasty pushing hard and Clark sitting 147 PF behind Airhead and 140 PF behind party cat, this is a true elimination-threat game.

If Clark wants to return to the postseason, he must take care of business.

5. party cat (7–6, 1941.5 PF) – 5th place

Party cat is perhaps the most volatile playoff hopeful in the league. The ceiling has been high, the lows have been brutal, and the PF profile suggests a team that can beat anyone or lose to anyone on any given week. At 7–6, the mission is identical to Clark and Maximum Effort: win and you’re in. But party cat has arguably the toughest opponent possible — dug (11–2) — a titan with nothing to play for but pride and bragging rights.

Party cat’s PF is slightly worse than Clark’s and farther behind Airhead’s, meaning the tiebreaker math doesn't work out great for them. A win locks them in at 8–6, but a loss creates a cluster of dangerous outcomes. In loss scenarios, party cat makes the playoffs only about 41% of the time, and most of those comes from needing BOTH Momma’s and DEANS to lose while also dodging a big FINN week.

The biggest danger? party cat can realistically be passed by any of the 6–7 teams in PF if Week 14 goes sideways. The FINN/Momma/DEANS mini-tier is separated from party cat by only 14–66 PF, meaning one above-expectation week could undo party cat completely. Given that their projection (154.2) is far below dug’s monster upside, the margin for error is thin.

Week 14 is not just a win-and-in game for party — it’s a must-win to avoid the mathematical minefield behind him.

6. Maximum Effort (7–6, 1763.3 PF) – 6th place

Maximum Effort is the single strangest playoff hopeful in the league: a 7–6 team with the lowest PF among all contenders, meaning he loses every single meaningful tiebreaker. He has no PF leverage. None. In 7–7 ties, especially multi-team ties, Max almost always falls to the bottom. So despite having the same record as Clark and party cat, his playoff odds are dramatically more fragile — he is effectively in a must-win situation.

The problem: his opponent is El Pretzel, a top-2 juggernaut fighting to hold onto a first-round bye. Max Efforts projection (148.4) sets him up as a sizable underdog in a game where <15% of loss outcomes keep him alive. Even if he loses and Momma’s, FINN, and DEANS all lose, Max can still be passed by monster PF swings from the 6–7 pack. His PF disadvantage (down 364 to FINN, 338 to Momma, and 312 to DEANS!) means he cannot rely on tiebreakers under any circumstances.

The good news: Max’s path is brutally simple. Win and he’s in the playoffs at 8–6. Lose and he’s almost definitely out.

This is the biggest must-win game of Week 14 — the entire season rests on an upset of one of the league’s best teams.

7. FINN RULES (6–7, 2127.7 PF) – 7th place

FINN RULES enters Week 14 as the strongest of the 6–7 teams and arguably the most dangerous spoiler candidate in the field. His PF is extremely competitive — in fact, his 2127.7 is higher than parties cat, Clark, and Max Effort. In the entire bubble tier, only Airhead and Pretzel have more points. That means FINN wins almost every PF tiebreaker, making his playoff hopes surprisingly strong for a 6–7 team.

The path is clear:
Win, and FINN makes the playoffs in roughly 88% of all win scenarios.
His matchup vs Coming Up (3–10) is extremely favorable, with a 24+ point projection advantage and a chance to post a monster PF week to leapfrog Momma’s and DEANS.

If FINN loses, he is eliminated. Simple as that. A 6–8 finish leaves him with no mathematical path given the number of 7–6 or higher teams.

FINN could realistically finish as high as the 4-seed in some scenarios, depending on how the 7–6 tier collapses. His strong PF history is his biggest weapon, and Week 14 is about cashing in on it.

8. Momma’s Boys (6–7, 2101.5 PF) – 8th place

Momma’s Boys are a pure chaos team: high variance, PF in the competitive range, and a matchup that could go sideways in either direction. The season has been turbulent — massive scoring spikes followed by injury slumps — but Momma enters Week 14 very much alive. The matchup vs Steal the Teal (5–8) favors him, but not overwhelmingly, and Momma’s PF position is not as strong as FINN’s.

Momma must win to stay alive. With a win, he reaches 7–7 and can leapfrog Clark, party cat, and Max Effort if ANY of them lose and his PF outpaces their Week 14 totals. He also needs to keep pace with FINN, staying within 26 PF to maintain tie leverage if both go 7–7. In scenario simulations, a Momma win produces playoff entry in 69% of worlds — significantly better than DEANS but noticeably worse than FINN.

The danger is that Momma could be outscored by DEANS or FINN even in win worlds, especially if he posts a mediocre week. His PF is good, but it is not elite. Week 14 requires a balanced approach: win the matchup, but also keep the pedal down for PF safety.

Momma needs a win and a little help — but far less help than the standings alone suggest.

9. DEANS Dynasty (6–7, 2075.3 PF) – 9th place

DEANS is the third of the 6–7 hopefuls, and while his PF is the lowest of the trio, it is still close enough to make up ground. His Week 14 matchup against Clark is essentially an elimination game for both sides, with the winner taking a massive leap toward the playoffs and the loser almost certainly ending their season.

The problem for DEANS is the PF math: he trails Momma by 26 PF and FINN by 52 PF. These swings are not impossible, but they require an above-average week from DEANS and below-average weeks from the other 6–7 teams. He also needs at least one of party cat or Max Effort to lose, and ideally both. In scenario modeling, a DEANS win yields playoff entry in only 41% of possible worlds — respectable, but meaningfully lower than Momma and FINN.

If DEANS loses, he is mathematically eliminated. A 6–8 finish cannot compete with the 7–6 group. His entire season hinges on keeping pace in the first half of the Sunday slate and maintaining PF proximity to Momma and FINN.

This is a pressure cooker matchup with huge bracket implications — DEANS is very much alive, but the path is narrow.

10. CeeDeez Nuts (5–8, 2040.9 PF) – 10th place (Eliminated)

CeeDeez enters Week 14 eliminated, but the season deserves a proper recap. The roster never fully stabilized after early injuries and midseason inconsistency at QB, and despite a few impressive peaks, the team struggled to convert winnable weeks into victories. The PF total (2040.9) shows a competitive squad, but not one capable of rising above the chaos of the 7–7 bubble.

The matchup vs Airhead is an opportunity to play spoiler — and spoiler alone. Eliminated teams often become kingmakers, and a CeeDeez upset could crush Airhead’s chances of a 3-seed or potential bye. But from a big-picture standpoint, Week 14 is more about evaluating the season’s bright spots, especially young players who flashed in the second half.

From here, it’s about preparing for 2026 and returning stronger.

11. Steal the Teal (5–8, 1859.4 PF) – 11th place (Eliminated)

Steal the Teal’s season never quite found stability, and the record reflects it. With the second-lowest PF in the league and an uphill battle most weeks, Steal consistently found themselves outmatched by higher-scoring opponents even in competitive games. The midseason QB shuffle and inconsistent WR production left the roster needing miracles that never fully materialized.

Week 14 offers a chance at a silver lining: a win over Momma could disrupt the playoff race dramatically. Steal has done this before — playing spoiler late — and would love nothing more than to drag another contender into chaos. But in the big-picture recap, this team struggled to keep pace offensively and rarely benefited from boom weeks needed to overcome league-average scoring.

The offseason brings an opportunity to build around a few promising pieces and reset expectations.

12. Coming Up From Below (3–10, 1675.2 PF) – 12th place (Eliminated)

It’s been a tough year for Coming Up From Below, but also an instructive one. The roster never found a rhythm, the PF total sits last in the league, and injuries and roster churn made weekly stability a challenge. Early voids at RB and midseason QB chaos put this team in a deep hole that became impossible to climb out of.

Still, the team showed flashes late in the season that suggest a foundation exists. Lessons can be learned from this year and the final weeks became more about development than standings. Week 14’s matchup vs FINN RULES is, realistically, a formality — but even a modest scoring week could add drama to the playoff picture by influencing PF tiebreakers.

The focus now shifts to 2026 — regrouping, retooling, and returning with a clean slate.
