      <h2>Week 9 Match-Up Previews</h2>
      <div class="section-content">
        <div class="game-recap">
          <h3>Week 9 game previews: </h3>
          <p>Christian McCaffrey had a blowout performance after an already strong start to the season helping lead dug to a record-shattering 248-point performance that set the league's all-time record for points in a game! (Check others below.) In his post-game interview, dug said his key to success was "having a great draft and having a few sleepers go off. Moving on to the closest game of." His opponent El Pretzel said in his post-game interview after the disappointing performance, "I'm up for a trade if it is reasonable. But I have faith in my team as it is," showing that we could see some trade action for the first time this season!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="game-recap">
          <h3>Team Clark (173.4) def. FINN RULES (149.0)</h3>
          <p><strong>Jonathan Taylor</strong> led the charge with 45.8 points as Team Clark outlasted Finn Rules. Travis Hunter also had a breakout game this week and when asked if he felt comfortable continuing to start him, the head coach said this: "I don't, but I'm limited on options." So hopefully Hunter can go out there and prove him wrong next week. As for FINN RULES, he came up just short as the effort by McBride wasn't quite enough. When we asked the coach if he was interested in trading any TEs since he has depth at the position, he said, "I'm always looking for more TEs!" so just FINN RULES being FINN RULES lol.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="game-recap">
          <h3>Maximum Effort (126.9) def. Momma’s Boys (103.8)</h3>
          <p>It wasn't the prettiest performance for Maximum Effort, but sometimes you've just gotta get gritty and that's what their team did this week, pulling it out with 126 points. When asked about the game, the coach said he was benching his kicker after that performance and may cut him, so look out for that! Momma's Boys were less hopeful about their season after this game, saying she's "concerned" and doesn’t think her team will finish above .500 (ouch!).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="game-recap">
          <h3>Dean’s Dynasty (171.9) def. CeeDeez Nuts (157.0)</h3>
          <p>After a close game, Dean's Dynasty managed to barely pull it out, winning by just 15 points. He could've kept it from getting close had he put Keenan Allen in, and after the game told us this: "Allen is my best receiver and will help with his resurgence as a consecutive 3-time champion." When CeeDeez Nuts was asked about his loss, he did some reflecting and took the blame himself, saying "I feel like my team is great and only getting better. I need to work on my coaching, but other than that, we're amazing — and as a wise man once said, 'If you're not first, you're last.'" So let's see if CeeDeez can keep it going and overcome the gap between him and dug.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="game-recap">
          <h3>Airhead (188.9) def. Steal the Teal (176.7)</h3>
          <p>This was one of the best matchups of the week, with Steal the Teal going into MNF up around 40 points (176.7–132.4), but Jahmyr Gibbs had something to say about that and blew up for 56.5 points, winning Airhead the week. When asked about her loss, Steal the Teal’s coach said, "I think I'm going to keep on losing games, cause idk what happened, I was doing good and now I kinda suck," so hurts to hear but at least she's being honest with herself!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="game-recap">
          <h3>Party Cat (192.3) def. Coming Up From Below (108.1)</h3>
          <p>Ja'Marr Chase and Justin Herbert put their all into it, scoring a combined 98.3 points for Party Cat. When asked what happened, CUFB's coach said, "I literally have 5 players that are out/questionable/IR, so not a lot of hope it'll get better," and trust me, I feel you there — the injury bug stops for no one. After Party Cat's strong performance, she stayed focused on improving, saying, "I would love to get a better running back, but don't have anything keyed up," so another possible trade to look out for!</p>

      <h3>Week 9 – Clinch & Elimination Scenarios</h3>

      <div class="scenario-note">
        <p><strong>Context:</strong> Six regular-season games remain (Weeks 9–14). Top 6 teams qualify for playoffs, top 2 receive first-round byes. Below are each team’s outlooks entering Week 9.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="scenario-grid">

        <div><strong>dug (8-0)</strong><br>
          Near lock for 1st place (92 %) and already at 0 % elimination. Can clinch the #1 seed within two weeks with any win or Team Clark loss.</div>

        <div><strong>Team Clark (6-2)</strong><br>
          Heavy favorite for a bye (54 % chance top-2). Controls its destiny and would clinch playoffs with one more win and a bubble-team loss.</div>

        <div><strong>CeeDeez Nuts (5-3)</strong><br>
          92 % chance to finish top-6 and 3 % elimination. A win plus losses by FINN RULES and Party Cat would nearly seal a spot.</div>

        <div><strong>Maximum Effort (5-3)</strong><br>
          Still in a strong position for middle seeding (≈ 79 % top-6). Needs consistency to avoid falling into the bubble tier.</div>

        <div><strong>Airhead (4-4)</strong><br>
          True bubble team (74 % chance of making it). Divisional wins remain critical for tiebreakers and maintaining playoff control.</div>

        <div><strong>Party Cat (4-4)</strong><br>
          58 % chance to make the playoffs, but a loss this week could drop to under 40 %. High-variance team depending on points-for tiebreakers.</div>

        <div><strong>FINN RULES (3-5)</strong><br>
          Roughly 35 % path to top-6 and 65 % elimination risk. Must win vs Steal the Teal to keep hope alive.</div>

        <div><strong>El Pretzel (3-5)</strong><br>
          27 % shot at survival. Holds head-to-head edge over Teal but needs two straight wins to avoid falling to single-digit odds.</div>

        <div><strong>Steal the Teal (3-5)</strong><br>
          21 % chance to reach the postseason. Elimination odds jump to 80 % with another loss this week.</div>

        <div><strong>Momma’s Boys (3-5)</strong><br>
          14 % top-6 probability. Needs a win and help from upsets to stay mathematically alive.</div>

        <div><strong>Dean’s Dynasty (3-5)</strong><br>
          About 11 % path remaining. Must beat dug this week to stay off the elimination line.</div>

        <div><strong>Coming Up From Below (1-7)</strong><br>
          Officially eliminated from playoff contention (100 % elimination). Will look to play spoiler for the remaining weeks.</div>
