    <section class="section">
      <h2>Week 10 Match-Up Previews</h2>
      <div class="section-content">

        <div class="game-recap">
          <h3>Airhead (5-6) vs FINN RULES (6-5)</h3>
          <p>This matchup could go either way with both teams rolling out the backups as byes hit them hard. Airhead needs this one to get back to .500 while a win for FINN RULES would make his playoff spot feel much more secure. Our key match up in this game will be the Te's with Bowers v. McBride being Te 1 and 2, we think the better performer will carry their team over the finish line. We'll give the advantage to Airhead, although an explosive game from Williams could cause trouble.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="game-recap">
          <h3>maximum Effort(7-4) vs DEANS Dynasty (4-7)</h3>
          <p>Coming into this game Maximum Effort has the better record but DEANS Dynasty isn't going to give up easily. Our key matchup for this game will be the Rb's with DEANS Dynasty appearing to have a large advantage a big week from his Rb's could seal Maximum Efforts loss. But Maximum Effort has a lot to play for and will be giving his full effort this week which could make the match up interesting. Our model leaned DEANS Dynasty due to a strong team core but this one could really go either way.</p>
        </div>

	<div class="game-recap">
          <h3>Coming Up From Below (2-7) vs Party Cat (6-5)</h3>
          <p>With CUFB being the seasons first eliminated team they'll be playing for pride. Many of their starters are healed up as well meaning she could play spoiler to party cats playoff hopes. She's in a good position to do so too with party cat having 9 players out, suspended (keep your spit to yourself Ja'marr), or on bye. party cat will need a big game from Andrews to have a shot but we're predicting a CUFB win.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="game-recap">
          <h3>CeeDeez Nuts (5-6) vs Steal the Teal (3-8)</h3>
          <p> This game looks to be tough for both teams with a combined 10 players on bye or injured, especially with CeeDeez losing their Qb for the season. But, Steal the Teal will have to de everything she can this week as her playoffs scenario is getting dire. A big performance from Adams and Jefferson could do it. CeeDeez will need a big performance but Mahomes and Lamb should help that but he'll need some strong games from his depth pieces if he wants to pull it out with his injury/bye situation. Our model has this one going Steal the Teal's way.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="game-recap">
          <h3>El Pretzel (6-5) vs Team Clark (7-4)</h3>
          <p>Team Clark is stretched thin this week with his Qb on a bye and the best one on the wire being Davis Mills (the Texans backup), while El Pretzel is coming in strong with only 2 players on a bye or injured. This game comes with big implications though, with the winner being my favorite for the 2nd bye. The model thinks it'll be a slog but they give the edge to El Pretzel due to his teams availability.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="game-recap">
          <h3>dug (10-1) Vs Momma's Boys (5-6)</h3>
          <p>With dug taking their first loss of the season last week the undefeated dream is unfortantely over and they'll look to rebound this week. With 2 mostly healthy rosters this one will be very interesting and could come down to our key match up which for this game will be St. Brown Vs Puka Nacua. dug being so consistent with scores above 190 in 6 weeks could be a problem for Momma's boys but they've now put 180+ plus two weeks in a row so while our model does have this game as a dug win it could still go either way.</p>

      <h3>Week 12 – Clinch & Elimination Scenarios</h3>
      <div class="scenario-note">
        <p><strong>Context:</strong> Three regular-season games remain (Weeks 11–14). Top 6 qualify; top 2 receive first-round byes.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="scenario-grid">

        <div><strong>dug (10–1)</strong><br>
          Already clinched playoffs. Clinches the No. 1 seed with a win AND losses by Clark + Effort. No scenario exists where Dug finishes below 2nd.
        </div>

        <div><strong>Team Clark (7–4)</strong><br>
          A win pushes playoff odds above 97%. Clinches with a win AND losses by Momma’s Boys + CeeDeez Nuts + Airhead. Still barely alive for the #1 seed.
        </div>

        <div><strong>Maximum Effort (7–4)</strong><br>
          Can clinch this week with a win plus losses by CeeDeez Nuts, Momma’s Boys, and Airhead. A loss throws them back into the 6-seed traffic jam.
        </div>

        <div><strong>El Pretzel (6–5)</strong><br>
          Cannot clinch this week but remains in strong position. A win gives them >85% playoff odds. A loss pulls them into the 5-way tie zone.
        </div>

        <div><strong>FINN RULES (6–5)</strong><br>
          Controls their path. A win keeps them in the playoff picture; a loss opens elimination pathways. Cannot clinch or be eliminated this week.
        </div>

        <div><strong>party cat (6–5)</strong><br>
          Massive bye-week problems this week. Can be eliminated with a loss AND wins by CeeDeez Nuts + Momma’s Boys + Airhead.
        </div>

        <div><strong>Momma’s Boys (5–6)</strong><br>
          Needs a win desperately. Eliminated this week with a loss AND wins by CeeDeez Nuts + Airhead + Steal the Teal.
        </div>

        <div><strong>CeeDeez Nuts (5–6)</strong><br>
          Nearly identical situation as Momma’s Boys. Needs a win to stay even. Elimination possible with a loss + multiple bubble wins.
        </div>

        <div><strong>Airhead (5–6)</strong><br>
          Another bubble team with no margin left. A win restores playoff hope; a loss combined with other wins could trigger elimination.
        </div>

        <div><strong>Dean’s Dynasty (4–7)</strong><br>
          Season on the brink. Eliminated with a loss AND any of the 6-win teams winning. Must win out to have a path.
        </div>

        <div><strong>Steal the Teal (3–8)</strong><br>
          Needs to win out AND get help. Eliminated this week with a loss or any win by the 5-win cluster.
        </div>

        <div><strong>Coming Up From Below (2–9)</strong><br>
          Officially eliminated. Spoiler role activated.
