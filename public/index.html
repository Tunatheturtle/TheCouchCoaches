        <div class=""game recap">
          <h3>Week 7 Recap: Christian McCarried</h3>
          <p>Christian McCaffery hed a blowout performance after an already strong start to the season helping lead dug to a record shattering 248 point performance, that set the leagues all time record for points in a game!(check others below) In his post game interview dug said his key to success was "having a great draft and having a few sleepers go ogg Moving on to the closest game off". His opponent El Pretzel said in his post game interview after the dissapoitning performancee "I'm up for a trade if it is reasonable. But I have faith in my team as it is" showing that we could see some trade action for the first time this season! </p>
 </div>

<!-- Game 2 -->
    <div class="game-recap">
      <h3>Team Clark (173.4) def. FINN RULES (149.0)</h3>
      <p><strong>Jonathan Taylor</strong> led the charge with 45.8 points as Team Clark outlasted Finn Rules. Travis Hunter also had a breakout game this week and when asked if he felt comfortable continuing to start him the head coach said this "I don't but I'm limited on options" So hopefully Hunter can go out there and prove him wrong next week. As for FINN RULES he came up just short as the effort by McBride wasn't quite enough. When we asked the couch if he was interested in trading any Te's as he has depth at the position, the coach said "I'm always looking for more Te's!" so just FINN RULES being FINN RULES lol.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Game 3 -->
    <div class="game-recap">
      <h3>Maximum Effort (126.9) def. Momma‚Äôs Boys (103.8)</h3>
      <p>It wasn't the prettiest performance for Maximum Effort but sometimes you've just gotta get gritty and that's what their team did this week pulling it out with 126 points. When asked about the game the coach said he was benching his kicker after that performance and may cut him so look out for that! Momma's boys were less hopeful about their season after this game saying shes "concerned" and doesnt think her team will finish above .500 (ouch!)</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Game 4 -->
    <div class="game-recap">
      <h3>Dean‚Äôs Dynasty (171.9) def. CeeDeez Nuts (157.0)</h3>
      <p>After a close game Dean's Dynasty managed to barely pull it out winning by just 15 points, he could've kept it from getting close had he put Keenan Allen in and after the game told us this "Allen is my best reciever and will help with his resurgence as a consecutive 3 time champion". When CeeDeez Nuts was asked about his loss he did some reflecting and took the blame himself saying "I feel like my team is great and only getting better, I need to work on my coaching but other than that we're amazing and as a wise man once said "If you're not first you're last". So lets see if CeeDeez can keep it going and overcome the gap between him and dug.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Game 5 -->
    <div class="game-recap">
      <h3>Airhead (188.9) def. Steal the Teal (176.7)</h3>
      <p>This was one of the best matchups of the week with Steal the Teal going into MNF up around 40 points 176.7-132.4 but Jahmyr Gibbs had something to say about that and blew up for 56.5 points winning Airhead the week. When asked about her loss, Steal the Teals coach said this "I think I'm going to keep onlosing games, cause idk what happened, I was doing good and now I kinda suck" so hurts to hear but at least she's being honest with herself! </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Game 6 -->
    <div class="game-recap">
      <h3>Party Cat (192.3) def. Coming Up From Below (108.1)</h3>
      <p>Jamaar Chase and Justin Herbet put they're all into it scoring a combined 98.3 points for party cat. When asked whatr happened CUFB's coach said "I literally have 5 palyers that are out/questionable/IR so not a lot of hope it'll get better" and trust me I feel you there, the injury bug stops for no one. After party cats strong performance she stayed focused on improving saying "I would love to get a better running back, but don't have anything keyed up" so another possible trade to look out for!</p>
