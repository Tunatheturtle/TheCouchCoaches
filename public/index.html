      <h2>Week 9 Match-Up Previews</h2>
      <div class="section-content">
        <div class="game-recap">
          <h3>Week 9 game previews: </h3>
	  <h3>El Pretzel (3-5) v. Airhead (4-4)</h3>
          <p>El Pretzel comes in to this week still holding onto hope for a playoff birth with a 27% chance to make the playoffs this will be a big week for them. On the other hand Airhead comes in doing a bit better but not by much with a 74% chance of making the playoffs. A win for Airhead would certainly be helpful in solidyfing a playoff birth while a loss would put them at a below 50% chance to make it. Our model has Airhead winning this game 154.3-146.7 so El Pretzel will be hoping for a big game from Josh Allen and James cook to keep them alive at this point.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="game-recap">
          <h3>FINN RULES (3-5) V. Steal the Teal (3-5)</h3>
          <p>This is a true bubble bowl with both teams sitting at 3-5 this game will have big playoff implications so its one to watch! Both teams could get to about a 50% shot at the playoffs but the loser will fall to a probability in the teens. For this game with FINN RULES having the overall TE 1 and Steal The Teal's dissapointing season so far due to some injuries our model gave the edge to FINN RULES projecting a 142.7-136.9 win for FINN RULES. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="game-recap">
          <h3>Maximum Effort (5‚Äì3) vs Coming Up From Below (1‚Äì7)</h3>
          <p>This game features our first eliminated team hoping to play spoiler to Maximum Effort's playoff chances. CUFB Injuries have plagued her season so far but with all but 1 of her players expected to be back to health it could give her team the juice it needs to secure win 2 on the season. Unfortunately for her though in what our model predicts to be a bit of a blowout we're expecting the final score to be 168.4-122.6 in favor of Maximum Effort. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="game-recap">
          <h3>Team Clark (6‚Äì2) vs Momma‚Äôs Boys (3‚Äì5)</h3>
          <p>In what could be a big game for both teams Team Clark is looking for a win to make them a heavy favorite for the 2nd bye spot while Momma's Boys is looking to keep her shot at the playoffs alive. This game is looking like it could be a close one and could certainly be a contender for game of the week, with Puka Nacua hopefully coming back from injury this week it could give Momma's boys the extra power they need to get the upset win over Team Clark and keep their playoff chances alive. Our model ended up giving the edge to Team clark in a 161.1-132.8 win.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="game-recap">
          <h3>Deans Dynasty (3‚Äì5) vs dug (8‚Äì0)</h3>
          <p>Coming off a win last week Deans Dynasty needs to keep their momentum going if they'd like a true shot at the playoffs, however that won't come easy against our leagues only undefeated team left in dug. ESPN isn't projecting this game to be super close but with players like Bijan and Keenan Allen their team certainly has some boom potential even with their qb situation looking a little iffy. While dug's got his playoff birth locked up a win here would all but gaurantee them a bye with only 5 games left in the season and with the win a 2 game lead he would have to lose more than he won in those last 5 games to lose the bye. Unfortunately for Deans Dynasty though our model predicts a 177.9-138.2 loss for them.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="game-recap">
          <h3>CeeDeez Nuts (5‚Äì3) vs Party Cat (4‚Äì4)</h3>
          <p>This is this weeks game of the week with 2 teams who are both right in the thick of the playoff race. This game could go either way with CeeDeez Nuts having CeeDee and party cat having Ja'Marr both teams could put up crazy points any given week. This game also has big playoff implications with a win for CeeDeez Nuts just about locking up a playoff birth while a win for party cat puts them on pace to make the playoffs with a 68% chance with a win. Our model had this game as the closest of the week giving the edge to CeeDeez Nuts in a 158.5-155.4 nail biter of a game.</p>

      <h3>Week 9 ‚Äì Clinch & Elimination Scenarios</h3>

      <div class="scenario-note">
        <p><strong>Context:</strong> Six regular-season games remain (Weeks 9‚Äì14). Top 6 teams qualify for playoffs, top 2 receive first-round byes. Below are each team‚Äôs outlooks entering Week 9.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="scenario-grid">

        <div><strong>dug (8-0)</strong><br>
          Near lock for 1st place (92 %) and already at 0 % elimination. Can clinch the #1 seed within two weeks with any win or Team Clark loss.</div>

        <div><strong>Team Clark (6-2)</strong><br>
          Heavy favorite for a bye (54 % chance top-2). Controls its destiny and would clinch playoffs with one more win and a bubble-team loss.</div>

        <div><strong>CeeDeez Nuts (5-3)</strong><br>
          92 % chance to finish top-6 and 3 % elimination. A win plus losses by FINN RULES and Party Cat would nearly seal a spot.</div>

        <div><strong>Maximum Effort (5-3)</strong><br>
          Still in a strong position for middle seeding (‚âà 79 % top-6). Needs consistency to avoid falling into the bubble tier.</div>

        <div><strong>Airhead (4-4)</strong><br>
          True bubble team (74 % chance of making it). Divisional wins remain critical for tiebreakers and maintaining playoff control.</div>

        <div><strong>Party Cat (4-4)</strong><br>
          58 % chance to make the playoffs, but a loss this week could drop to under 40 %. High-variance team depending on points-for tiebreakers.</div>

        <div><strong>FINN RULES (3-5)</strong><br>
          Roughly 35 % path to top-6 and 65 % elimination risk. Must win vs Steal the Teal to keep hope alive.</div>

        <div><strong>El Pretzel (3-5)</strong><br>
          27 % shot at survival. Holds head-to-head edge over Teal but needs two straight wins to avoid falling to single-digit odds.</div>

        <div><strong>Steal the Teal (3-5)</strong><br>
          21 % chance to reach the postseason. Elimination odds jump to 80 % with another loss this week.</div>

        <div><strong>Momma‚Äôs Boys (3-5)</strong><br>
          14 % top-6 probability. Needs a win and help from upsets to stay mathematically alive.</div>

        <div><strong>Dean‚Äôs Dynasty (3-5)</strong><br>
          About 11 % path remaining. Must beat dug this week to stay off the elimination line.</div>

        <div><strong>Coming Up From Below (1-7)</strong><br>
          Officially eliminated from playoff contention (100 % elimination). Will look to play spoiler for the remaining weeks.</div>
