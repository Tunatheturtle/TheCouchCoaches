<div class="matchup">
  <p>
    After fourteen weeks of regular-season chaos, injuries, waiver-wire gambles, point-total heartbreaks, and a grueling playoff round 1,
    <strong>The Couch Coaches</strong> playoff semifinals have arrived.
  </p>

  <p>
    The season has come down to its last four teams each with their own journey to get this far.
    One top seed chasing validation after 2 years of being just not good enough. One dynasty hunting immortality with a mind blowing threepeat.
    And two franchises standing on the edge of their first ever championship appearance.
  </p>

  <p>
    By the end of this weekend, two seasons will be over — and two legacies will continue.

<!--   SEMIFINAL MATCHUP #1    -->
<!-- ========================= -->

<div class="matchup">
  <h2>#1 Dug (12–2) vs #5 Momma’s Boys (7–7)</h2>
  <h3>The Favorite vs The Survivor</h3>

  <p>
    Dug enters the semifinals as the league’s most dominant regular-season force, earning the 1 seed with a 12–2 record and a roster thats been able to stay consistent throughout the season. His lineup is anchored by elite, high-floor stars with 8 of his starting 10 being top 10 players at their position, with the 2 that aren't being his Te and D/St. In my opinion this high floor is what helps set dugs team apart as a favorite in this playoff race.
  </p>

  <p>
    But the playoffs have a way of ignoring resumes and creating it's own kind of chaos, and standing in Dug’s path is Momma’s Boys. Momma's boys has been a team that's clawed its way into the postseason and is building momentum at the right time winning 6 of their last 8 and with Puka Nacua you never know how many points their team could put up. With a dangerously high upside kind of team all kt would take is a strong game from a few players to put her in the championship.  </p>

  <p>
    The path to victory for dug is clear, keep doing what he'e been doing. with an average ppg of a whopping 188.5 an average game from this team is likely all it will take for them to pull it off. For dug the picture is this: play their game and hope for no heroic performances from Momma's boys
  </p>

  <p>
    On the other end for Momma's boys the patch to vitctory is a little less clear but still doable. With Treveyon Henderson putting up 51.5 last week and puka having 2 40+ point games in a row, if they can carry their momentum it will do a lot of the work for Momma's boys. Rashee Rice is also interesting as Minshew could provide a bump or a dump for his performance, could Rice be Minshews new favvorite target? I'll say it again with a team of Henderson, Rice, Nacua, Kittle, Barkley, and Love all it'd take is the ball falling the right way a few times for Mooma's boys to win.
 </p>

  <p>
    When it comes down to it I'm going to go with the safe pick for this game and pick Dug as my winner. the ppg advantage of 188.5 to 163.4 is just a little to much for me to give the edge to Momma's boys. But I maintain that there's a very real world where Momma's boys takes this game and ESPN even agrees with that as Momma's boys is favored in app by 11 points. All in all I'd set my line at dug -17 over Momma's boys

<!--   SEMIFINAL MATCHUP #2    -->
<!-- ========================= -->

<div class="matchup">
  <h2>#2 El Pretzel (8–6) vs #6 DEANS Dynasty (7–7)</h2>
  <h3>The Challenger vs The Dynasty</h3>

  <p>
    No team in The Couch Coaches casts a longer shadow than DEANS Dynasty. Two straight championships have turned this teams roster managements into the league’s standard. and with this teams turnaround since the start of the season, they're another team catching their stride at the perfect time having won 5 in a row and 8 of their last 10.
  </p>

  <p>
    But this year once again like last year, DEANS enters the semifinals without the comfort of a top seed and keep in mind last year that didn't matter. However he comes into this match facing an El Pretzel squad that quietly built one of the league’s most balanced lineups with few holes and quietly solid players. One of the biggest surprises for El Pretzel has been the new Titans rookie he added from waivers back in October, Wr Chimere Dike who has been the 6th best wr as far as fantasy scoring due to his talent in the special teams game this season.
  </p>

  <p>
    For Deans Dynasty the road to the championship will be tough as the game between him and dug is expected to be a close one. For Dean it'll take an explosive week from Bijan and A.J. Brown if he wants to keep his chances alive. a turn around from George Pickens would also go a long way as he's been on a downtrend the last few weeks so a return to 40+ point games would be huge as well as a bounce back from Joey B after that shutout last week aginst the Ravens. 
  </p>

  <p>
    For El Pretzel the goal will be to keep on doing what he been doing with a ppg of 2nd in the league of 165.85 he has the advantage over Deans Dynasty, the question will be can he keep it going for another week as his team is suspect in some areas with players like Devin Neal starting.
  </p>

  <p>
    Overall I'd give the edge to Deans dynasty, the momentum he's carrying feels strong and I like the upside that his team presents. ESPN agrees with me here giving Deans Beans a small 4 point advantage. I'd set my line at Deans Dynasty -6
  </p>

<!-- ========================= -->

<div class="matchup">
  <p>
    Dug is chasing the title that would cap years of sustained dominance.
    DEANS Dynasty is chasing history.
    Momma’s Boys and El Pretzel are chasing something they've only dreamed of so far - their first championship moment.
  </p>

  <p>
    By Sunday night, only two teams will remain.
    The rest will be left wondering what could have been.
